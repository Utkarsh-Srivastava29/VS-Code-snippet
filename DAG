No cycles ⇒ topological order ⇒ DP works for paths, counts, and scores on DAGs.


If a graph has a cycle, there is no "first" node to start from.


No cycles ⇒ topological order exists ⇒ dependencies resolved ⇒ DP works.

Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based) and dfs-based(DFS topo sort: push node on exit, reverse stack → topological order in O(V+E).)

Finding the longest path in a general graph is NP-hard.

dp[v] = source se v tak ka longest path.u → v.dp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1).dp[source] = 0.baaki sab = −∞.dp[destination].
Shortest path works the same way, use min instead of max


DAG mein shortest path nikaalna Dijkstra se bhi easy hota hai, kyunki cycles nahi hote.DAG mein shortest path = topo order + dp relaxation, no PQ needed.


dp[v]=min(dp[v],dp[u]+w(u,v)),relax all the outgoing edges (u,v).This runs in O(V+E) faster than Dijkstra O((E+V)logV).Space complexity is O(V) for the data structures used.

dp[v] = node v tak pahunchne ka maximum score.dp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + w(u,v)).Positive cycle → DP kabhi stable nahi hoga.
Max path + possible cycles ⇒ pehle positive cycle check from 1, phir DAG DP



Shortest Path Algorithm
     1. Compute topological order
     2. Initialize dp[source]=0, for all other to inf
     3. for each node u in topological order.For each edge (u,v) dp[v]=min(dp[v],dp[u]+w(u,v))
     4.dp[destination].So dp[u] is finalized and you can safely use it to update neighbours.This runs in O(V+E) time and uses O(V) space.


Cycles + longest path = danger
Longest path in a DAG finds the critical path or maximum reward, but with cycles it becomes impossible.



For general graphs directed or undirected with cycles we need to use BellmenFord-DP with negative edges.

DP State
dp[u] = maximum number of cities on any path from 1 to u
dp[1] = 1        // starting city counts
dp[others] = -∞
dp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] + 1)
If dp[n] == -∞ → IMPOSSIBLE
Else → dp[n] is the maximum cities
Longest Flight Route = longest path on a DAG by counting nodes, solved with topo + DP.


Longest Flight Route = topo order + dp + parent tracking + unreachable check..Ye unreachability zaroor check kro during the contest.
